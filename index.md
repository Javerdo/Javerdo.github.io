I am a graduate in Computer Science from the IT University in Copenhagen with a specialization in Advanced Data Systems and recently I completed a research project under
the supervision of Paul Rosero where we investigated and designed an IoT prototype to detect wildlife incursions at farmlands in Denmark. 
My interests lie in using C++ for High Performance Computing to increase throughput performance by exploiting the internal workings of hardware such as the CPU, GPU and
FPGA.
